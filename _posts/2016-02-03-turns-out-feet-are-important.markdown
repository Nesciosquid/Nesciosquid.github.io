After setting a three-hour print up to run overnight, I came back to lab this morning to find this lovely mess:

![The fall caused a pretty large y-axis offset, but the print continued on going anyway.](http://i.imgur.com/wUxADW8.jpg)

It looks like the printer worked itself off of the shelf I've had it sitting on, fell onto the radiator behind it, and somehow continued to print, managing some pretty impressive [bridging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_b6hFFcLh_Q) in the process. 

When I serviced the printer last week, one of the rubber feet went missing, and I had to remove the other three to keep it level. I didn't think much of it at the time, and figured they were for sound dampening purposes. My lab is noisy already, so sound isn't much of an issue.

Turns out, they're *actually* there to keep your printer from walking its way off of whatever surface you placed it on while it prints. Oops.

Big props to [Printrbot](https://twitter.com/printrbot) for building a machine that can fall over and keep on going, though! It looks like they're going to send me some replacements, too! <3
