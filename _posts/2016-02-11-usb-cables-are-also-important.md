Remember those rubber feet that [Printrbot](twitter.com/printrbot) was going to send me? 

Well, they did, they arrived, and now I have a bigger problem!

When I went to put the new feet on, I tipped the printer over onto its side so I could get at the bottom, and heard a *snap!*

I'd forgotten to remove the USB cable from the back, which levered against the board and snapped the USB connector right off of it. The bad news is that the printer will be out of commission until I can get a new board.

The good news, however, is that this company is awesome, and they sell [replacement boards](http://printrbot.com/shop/printrboard-rev-f/) for cheap on their website, just like all of their other parts. <3
