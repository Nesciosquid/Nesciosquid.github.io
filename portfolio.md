# [3DuF](http://heuckroth.com/3DuF)

### Microfluidics CAD -- Javascript -- May 2015

***

![](http://i.imgur.com/r4Gc2gtl.png){: .center-image }

3DuF was designed to be a user-friendly, browser-based CAD platform for designing and fabricating microfluidic devices. It features parametric representations of device components, which can be placed and modified using a simple, point-and-click interface. Designs can be saved as JSON objects and exported as vector art or 3D-printable models.

Freeforme is a simple web application that allows users to process free-entry CSV data from online surveys. The software supports a workflow which eliminates the effort of re-processing identical responses and makes it easier to group similar responses into categories, allowing for straightforward processing of free-response answers in an organized, efficient fashion.

### Teensy 3.1 Enclosure -- 3D Printing -- February 2015

***

![](http://i.imgur.com/avks0vql.png){: .center-image }

Final project for EC521 (Cybersecurity) at Boston University.

ScamDisk is a 3D printable enclosure for the Teensy 3.1 microcontroller which disguises it as a conventional USB stick. We used standard libraries to create human interface device (HID) payloads which can be activated by plugging the ScamDisk into a target system.

# [Browser Holograms](https://nesciosquidsecure.github.io/CS585_Project/demo/)

### Computer Vision and Augmented Reality -- Javascript -- March 2016

***

![](http://i.imgur.com/07SvkYD.jpg){: .center-image }

Final project for CS585 (Computer Vision) at Boston University.

This static web application uses webcam input to render 3D models as if they were holograms suspended in physical space. It uses an augmented reality javascript library to detect the presence of coded images in the webcam feed, calculates their 3D position and orientation, and uses Three.js to render a stylized hologram of the designated object.

# [Leader Election](http://www.heuckroth.com/LeaderElectionSimulator/)

### IoT Simulation -- Javascript -- November 2015

***

![](http://i.imgur.com/NmE3yj3l.png){: .center-image }

As part of our [Internet of Things course](https://github.com/Nesciosquid/EC544_demos), we ask our students to implement a mesh network of wireless devices which must dynamically form independent groups with other devices which are within connection range, with each group governed by a single, unanimously-elected leader.

This simulation demonstrates the basic concepts of leader election, and provides a visual description of the behavior we expect from their systems.

# [3-Axis Laser Mount](http://www.heuckroth.com/research/2016/02/29/lets-print-a-laser-turret/)

### Beam Steering Device -- 3D Printing and Electronics -- March 2016

***

![](http://i.imgur.com/BqcEdFCl.jpg){: .center-image }

I designed an inexpensive, parametric 3D-printable mount for aligning and securing a laser module in three-dimensional space.

# [3D Printed Light Sensors](http://www.heuckroth.com/research/2016/02/04/3D-printing-light-sensors/)

### Easy Photodetection with Arduinos -- 3D Printing and Electronics -- February 2016

***

![](http://i.imgur.com/QHDitZal.jpg){: .center-image }

I used off-the-shelf parts and my 3D printer to create modular light sensors for use in communications, VLC, and tracking.

# [Expectations and Identity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOprm4t7y8M)

### Video -- Writing, Animation, Music, etc. -- May 2016

***

![](http://i.imgur.com/XjimzUzl.png){: .center-image }

I created this video to voice some of my concerns over the way sensitive topics, particularly those surrounding gender identity, are approached through survey questions.

I also provide alternate methods of presenting survey questions that are more inclusive and help to avoid discrimination based on gender and other factors.

# [BUBOLO](https://github.com/BU-CS673/bubolo/)

### Computer Game -- Java, Software Engineering -- April 2014

***

![](http://i.imgur.com/Vm8SI91l.png){: .center-image }

Final project for MET CS673 (Software Engineering) at Boston University.

A remake of the classic top-down tank-shooter videogame Bolo, built from the ground up in Java. Our team included approximately 10 students, and the focus of the project was on enacting and following solid software engineering procedures, including unit and integration testing, pull requests, and code review. 

I acted as one of the project leaders and created the bulk of the backend game code, as well as all of the art and music assets for the game.

# [Brute Force](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT5K6WMti4E)

### Raytracing Engine -- Java, Algorithms -- April 2014

***

![](http://i.imgur.com/XCzoSFml.png){: .center-image }

Final project for EC504 (Advanced Data Structures) at Boston University.

Brute Force is a raytracing engine built in Java. It includes support for supersampled antialiasing, soft shadows, rendering arbitrary 3D models, as well as a (simplistic) graphical interface.
