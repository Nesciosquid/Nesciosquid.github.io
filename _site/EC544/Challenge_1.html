<tr><td style="width:400px;"><span><br><br><h2><b>Where is this data from?</b></h2>Sunspots were left in PHO 302 overnight. Spot 7811 was placed on a windowsill, 35EC in the middle of the room, and 3560 nearest the door.<br><br>
Timestamps for each datapoint were reported by individual spots, which were not calibrated to a central timepoint, but times should be accurate to within a few minutes. (Good enough for government work.)<br><br></span></td></tr>
<tr><td style="width: 400px"><span><h2><b>This chart is interactive!</b></h2>
Mouse over to highlight individual values. Click and drag to zoom. Double-clicking will zoom you back out. Shift-drag will pan.<br>
The roll period for moving average calculation is set to 60 minutes by default. You can change this by changing the number in the box and hitting enter.</span><br><br></td></tr>
<tr><td style="width: 400px"><span><h2><b>How is this graph made?</b></h2>
Individual temperature readings are recorded into a log .csv. This is converted to a multiple-series .csv, containing one column for time values and a value column for each mote detected since data collection start. The chart is plotted on this page using the <a href="http://www.dygraphs.com">dygraphs</a> charting library.</span><br><br></td></tr>
