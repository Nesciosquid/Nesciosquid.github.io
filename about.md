title: About Me
---

I'm currently a Computer Engineering PhD Student at Boston University, where I work with [Prof. Thomas Little](http://www.bu.edu/smartlighting/people/faculty/little/) and the [Multimedia Communications Lab](http://hulk.bu.edu/) to develop tools and techniques for indoor localization.

I like to make things like [software](https://github.com/Nesciosquid/), [3D printed devices](http://www.thingiverse.com/Nesciosquid/designs), and [music](https://soundcloud.com/kirrei/).

I teach a graduate-level Internet of Things course at BU, where our students create sensor networks, autonomous vehicles, and indoor localization systems from off-the-shelf consumer electronics. [Course materials are available online through GitHub.](https://github.com/Nesciosquid/EC544_demos)

I grew up in the [Bay Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area) and received a BS in Microbiology and a BA in Classical Civilizations from [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) in 2012. My previous work focused on [synthetic biology](http://2011.igem.org/Team:UC_Davis) and tools for [laboratory automation](https://github.com/Nesciosquid/3DuF). 

I'm gay, highly outspoken, and I want you to say hello! 

You can contact me by [email](mailto:a.heuckroth@gmail.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Nesciosquid), or by shouting my name really loud outside the [SLURP Lab](http://www.bu.edu/ece/undergraduate/instructional-laboratories/smart-lighting-undergraduate-research-program-slurp-laboratory/) on the second floor of the [BU Photonics Center](http://www.bu.edu/photonics/). (Please don't actually do that. People will think you're weird.)
