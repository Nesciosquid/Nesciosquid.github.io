title: About Me
---

I'm currently a full-stack software engineer at [Giant Otter](https://giantotter.com), where I primarily work with ES6 and React on the frontend, Python and Flask on the backend, and handle our interactions with a wide range of AWS cloud services.

I like to make things like [software](https://github.com/Nesciosquid/), [3D printed devices](http://www.thingiverse.com/Nesciosquid/designs), and [music](https://soundcloud.com/kirrei/).

I previously taught a graduate-level Internet of Things course at BU, where our students create sensor networks, autonomous vehicles, and indoor localization systems from off-the-shelf consumer electronics. [Course materials are available online through GitHub.](https://github.com/Nesciosquid/EC544_demos)

I grew up in the [Bay Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area) and received a BS in Microbiology and a BA in Classical Civilizations from [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) in 2012. My previous work focused on [synthetic biology](http://2011.igem.org/Team:UC_Davis) and tools for [laboratory automation](https://github.com/Nesciosquid/3DuF).

You can contact me by [email](mailto:aaron@heuckroth.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Nesciosquid). Say hello!
